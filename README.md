**I'm a software developer and a hobbyist language learner working on a variety of tools, keeping a scrupulous eye out for knowing how users interact with my applications.** I have a pedantic obsession in minimising as much friction as possible in their experience. Found an issue? Don't like something? Feel like something's missing? Let me know as soon as possible and I'll have a look.

If you need help with any of my tools or need assistance running any of my scripts, please feel free to reach out to me via any of my issue trackers, via Discord or by e-mail.
